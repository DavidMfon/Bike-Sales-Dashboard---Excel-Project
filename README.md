### Data Sources 📂

- Dataset: Customer bike sales dataset

- File Format: Excel Workbook (.xlsx)

### Tools 🛠️

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset was prepared for analysis using the following steps:

- Removal of duplicate records

- Standardization of inconsistent values using Find and Replace

- Formatting of numerical and categorical fields

- Structuring data to ensure compatibility with pivot tables and charts

### Exploratory Data Analysis 🔍

Exploratory analysis was carried out to understand:

- Distribution of bike purchases across customer demographics

- Income patterns among buyers and non buyers

- Relationship between commute distance and purchase behavior

- Purchase trends across age brackets, education levels, and regions

### Data Analysis 📊

The analysis was performed using pivot tables and summarized through charts, including:

- Average Income per Bike Purchase

- Customer Age Brackets Analysis

- Commute Distance versus Purchase Status

- Interactive slicers were added to allow users to filter insights by marital status, region, gender, education, commute distance, and purchase status.

### Results and Findings 📈

- Married customers generally have higher average income compared to single customers

- Higher income levels are associated with increased likelihood of bike purchases

- Commute distance influences purchasing decisions, with moderate distances showing higher purchase rates

- Certain regions show stronger bike purchase trends than others

### Recommendations 💡

- Target marketing campaigns toward higher income and married customer segments

- Promote bikes as an efficient solution for medium distance commuting

- Tailor product offerings based on regional customer preferences

- Use demographic insights to refine pricing and promotional strategies

### Limitations

- Analysis is limited to the variables provided in the dataset

- External factors such as pricing, brand preference, and economic conditions were not included

- Dataset represents a snapshot and may not reflect long term trends
